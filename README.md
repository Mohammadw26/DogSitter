IMPLEMENTATION:
Weeks 1 & 2:(8 hours)
During the initial two weeks of development, I focused on setting up the development environment for the Android application in Android Studio. This involved configuring the necessary tools, SDKs, and emulators to create a seamless working environment. Additionally, I integrated Firebase with the application, establishing a connection to this powerful backend platform. This provided a foundation for various features such as real-time data synchronization, authentication, and more. Concurrently, I began the process of designing the user interface (UI) for the application, working on wireframes and mockups to define the visual aspects of the app.

Challenges Faced: Configuring the development environment and integrating Firebase required careful attention to documentation and troubleshooting to ensure a smooth setup. Designing the UI involved creative decisions to strike a balance between aesthetic appeal and user-friendly functionality.

Weeks 3 & 4:(13 hours)
In these two weeks, I dedicated my efforts to implementing authentication using Firebase Firestore. This critical security feature allowed users to create accounts and authenticate themselves within the app. I successfully implemented the sign-up and sign-in functionality, providing users with a seamless onboarding experience. Additionally, I integrated Google Maps into the application, leveraging its capabilities to provide location-based services and enhance the user experience.

Challenges Faced: Working with authentication mechanisms required a deep understanding of Firebase's authentication APIs and handling potential error scenarios during user sign-up and sign-in. Integrating Google Maps involved dealing with API keys and learning how to leverage its features effectively.

Weeks 5 & 6: (14 hours)
During this phase, I focused on expanding the app's functionality. Users were now able to add dog sitter services, a core feature of the application. Additionally, I integrated a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) section with categories, enhancing user support and engagement. To bring the UI to life, I meticulously implemented XML layouts, ensuring that the visual elements aligned with the intended design.

Challenges Faced: Implementing the dog sitter service involved database design and establishing relationships between users and their services. Creating an organized and user-friendly layout for the FAQs required thoughtful categorization and user-centric design decisions.


Weeks 7 & 8: (12 hours)
In these two weeks, I integrated Firebase Realtime Database to complement the existing Firestore integration. The app's chat feature was implemented, enabling seamless communication between dog sitters and users. Both parties could engage in real-time conversations, enhancing the user experience and facilitating service requests.

Challenges Faced: Integrating multiple Firebase services required careful management of data synchronization and ensuring a coherent user experience. Implementing real-time chat necessitated handling message threading, notifications, and synchronization challenges.

Weeks 9 & 10: (13 hours)
During this phase, I focused on enhancing the app's user interface. I refined the visual elements, optimized layout designs, and ensured a consistent and polished look throughout the application. Additionally, I implemented a feature that allowed users to send service requests, enabling easy communication between service seekers and providers. The ability for service providers to accept or decline requests was also implemented, further streamlining the process.

Challenges Faced: Improving the UI required attention to detail, testing on different screen sizes, and addressing potential issues related to responsiveness and usability. Implementing the request and response system involved managing state changes and ensuring timely notifications for both parties.


Weeks 11 & 12: (10 hours)
In the final phase of development, I performed thorough testing of the application.
White box testing involved examining the codebase for any potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses, while black box testing focused on evaluating the app's functionality from a user's perspective. Identified bugs were promptly addressed and resolved, ensuring a stable and reliable user experience.

Challenges Faced: Testing and bug resolution required meticulous attention to detail, with a focus on uncovering and addressing edge cases and potential vulnerabilities.
