IMPLEMENTATION:
Weeks 1 & 2:(8 hours)
During the initial two weeks of development, I focused on setting up the development environment for the Android application in Android Studio. This involved configuring the necessary tools, SDKs, and emulators to create a seamless working environment. Additionally, I integrated Firebase with the application, establishing a connection to this powerful backend platform. This provided a foundation for various features such as real-time data synchronization, authentication, and more. Concurrently, I began the process of designing the user interface (UI) for the application, working on wireframes and mockups to define the visual aspects of the app.

Challenges Faced: Configuring the development environment and integrating Firebase required careful attention to documentation and troubleshooting to ensure a smooth setup. Designing the UI involved creative decisions to strike a balance between aesthetic appeal and user-friendly functionality.

Weeks 3 & 4:(13 hours)
In these two weeks, I dedicated my efforts to implementing authentication using Firebase Firestore. This critical security feature allowed users to create accounts and authenticate themselves within the app. I successfully implemented the sign-up and sign-in functionality, providing users with a seamless onboarding experience. Additionally, I integrated Google Maps into the application, leveraging its capabilities to provide location-based services and enhance the user experience.

Challenges Faced: Working with authentication mechanisms required a deep understanding of Firebase's authentication APIs and handling potential error scenarios during user sign-up and sign-in. Integrating Google Maps involved dealing with API keys and learning how to leverage its features effectively.

Weeks 5 & 6: (14 hours)
During this phase, I focused on expanding the app's functionality. Users were now able to add dog sitter services, a core feature of the application. Additionally, I integrated a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) section with categories, enhancing user support and engagement. To bring the UI to life, I meticulously implemented XML layouts, ensuring that the visual elements aligned with the intended design.

Challenges Faced: Implementing the dog sitter service involved database design and establishing relationships between users and their services. Creating an organized and user-friendly layout for the FAQs required thoughtful categorization and user-centric design decisions.


Weeks 7 & 8: (12 hours)
In these two weeks, I integrated Firebase Realtime Database to complement the existing Firestore integration. The app's chat feature was implemented, enabling seamless communication between dog sitters and users. Both parties could engage in real-time conversations, enhancing the user experience and facilitating service requests.

Challenges Faced: Integrating multiple Firebase services required careful management of data synchronization and ensuring a coherent user experience. Implementing real-time chat necessitated handling message threading, notifications, and synchronization challenges.

Weeks 9 & 10: (13 hours)
During this phase, I focused on enhancing the app's user interface. I refined the visual elements, optimized layout designs, and ensured a consistent and polished look throughout the application. Additionally, I implemented a feature that allowed users to send service requests, enabling easy communication between service seekers and providers. The ability for service providers to accept or decline requests was also implemented, further streamlining the process.

Challenges Faced: Improving the UI required attention to detail, testing on different screen sizes, and addressing potential issues related to responsiveness and usability. Implementing the request and response system involved managing state changes and ensuring timely notifications for both parties.


Weeks 11 & 12: (10 hours)
In the final phase of development, I performed thorough testing of the application.
White box testing involved examining the codebase for any potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses, while black box testing focused on evaluating the app's functionality from a user's perspective. Identified bugs were promptly addressed and resolved, ensuring a stable and reliable user experience.

Challenges Faced: Testing and bug resolution required meticulous attention to detail, with a focus on uncovering and addressing edge cases and potential vulnerabilities.

Weeks 13 & 14: (12 hours)
In the recent update, I focused on enhancing the application's user interface (UI) to provide a more intuitive and visually appealing experience for users. This involved refining the layout, color schemes, typography, and overall design elements to ensure a consistent and modern look.
Additionally, I performed a code refactoring to improve the maintainability and readability of the codebase. This involved restructuring the code while maintaining its functionality. I also introduced additional categories to the application, broadening its scope and providing users with a wider range of options and content to explore.
These changes collectively contribute to an improved user experience and a more organized and scalable codebase for future development.

Weeks 15&16: (48-50 hours)
Expanding Service Offerings: Catering to a Variety of Needs (Approx. 12 hours)
I am thrilled to introduce a significant enhancement to the Sitters app that is set to redefine the way users access and provide a diverse range of services. Building on my initial focus on dog sitting services, I have expanded the app's offerings to include a multitude of service categories, ranging from pet care to babysitting. This expansion opens up new horizons for both service providers and users, providing a comprehensive platform that caters to a wider array of needs.
Notification Marker Implementation (Approx. 10 hours)
Implementing the notification marker feature presented challenges in terms of real-time updates and efficient data synchronization. Ensuring that the marker accurately reflects new requests, updates to existing requests, and chat messages required careful handling of asynchronous events and data streams. Additionally, optimizing data queries and updates minimized the app's resource usage while providing timely notifications.
Reminder Setting for Service Dates (Approx. 12-13 hours)
Enabling service providers to set reminders posed challenges related to compatibility across various Android versions and devices. Achieving consistent functionality required integrating with system-level calendar and reminder APIs while considering platform-specific variations. By implementing a combination of platform-specific APIs and third-party libraries, I ensured that reminder setting was a seamless experience for users across different devices.
User Current Location on the Map (Approx. 4 hours)
Incorporating current location updates on the map necessitated overcoming challenges related to battery consumption and user privacy. I utilized Google Maps API along with Android's location services to provide accurate and efficient location tracking. Minimizing the impact on battery life was achieved through optimized location update intervals and intelligent usage of background services. Moreover, privacy concerns were addressed by implementing explicit user consent mechanisms and providing clear location-sharing controls.
Enhanced Input Checks and Bug Removal (Approx. 10-11 hours)
The task of implementing enhanced input checks and resolving existing bugs required a comprehensive approach to code review and testing. I performed rigorous testing across a range of scenarios to identify and rectify potential bugs. The challenge lay in maintaining a balance between thorough testing and efficient delivery. I adopted a combination of unit testing, automated UI testing, and real-world scenario testing to ensure a robust and reliable app.
